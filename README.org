* Network of Mastodon instances

Visualize the network of all Mastodon instances visible from your home
feed. There is an edge between instances A and B if someone from
instance A boosted a post from instance B.

/Inspired by [[https://mastodon.social/@judell/110147142486697213][this post]] from Jon Udell./

** Requirements

This tool requires Awk, [[https://graphviz.org/][Graphviz]], and [[https://steampipe.io/][Steampipe]] with its [[https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/mastodon][Mastodon plugin]].

Create a [[https://docs.joinmastodon.org/client/token/][Mastodon API token]] (Preferences → Development → New
application), and fill the ~access_token~ field in
=~/.steampipe/config/mastodon.spc=. (You can also set ~max_toots=-1~.)

** Instructions

Run =make=.

You get the visualization in PNG and SVG format.

** Example

From my home timeline on 2023-04-05, with 679 toots.
